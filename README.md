# projects
scripts or programs created in response to online challenges I decide to complete

INTRODUCTION:
So, I'm just a noob, learning to code on my own.

Reading and online tutorials only take me so far.

Throughout the web are resources of varying quality which contain challenges, or essentially, homework problems.

Most of the time I get stumped by the very description of a challenge. They're written in such a way that is foreign to me at this point in my development, and most of the time I have to decipher what the main thrust of the challenge is.

This repository is intended to be a collection of: 1. Selection of challenges to complete, and 2. My interpretation of said challenges.

My goal is to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Sensitive. 

So then my refined goal is: To complete and share challenges of increasing complexity within a day(or more) using Git/Github/Ruby and all available resources.

As this plan grows, evolves or dies, I'll update the repository as needed.

I'll reference the resources I do use somewhere, to keep it organized. For now, wish me luck!

To be continued........
